DESCRIPTION:
“Fortress Legends” is an alternate version of “Stick Hero” build using Java FX and various concepts of OOPS. This code is based on the plot that a warrior captures various forts one after the other and dodges the dragons on the way by vanishing itself.
IMPLEMENTATIONS:
•	The code uses various concepts of OOPS :
1.	Interface
2.	Inheritance
3.	Abstract classes
4.	Polymorphism
5.	Encapsulation

•	Java FX has been implemented in the provided code in order to build the game with great UI and animation.
•	The code uses J Unit testing to test various scenarios and cases             *(Dependencies to be added by the TA itself): 

1.	Testing for Stick Growth
2.	Test for Stick Hero initialization
3.	Test for the game/platform initialization

•	Two Design patterns have been used while implementing the code 
1.	Iterator Design Pattern- This pattern is used to iterates the created castles 
2.	Decorative Design Pattern -The warrior has a special ability to vanish itself and get invisible in order to dodge the dragons.

•	Error handling using Try Catch and Throws has also been implemented wherever required.

USE INSTRUCTIONS:
The game starts with a Home Page providing the user the option to Start the game.
The Highest score so far has also been made visible to the user.
The user is requested to press the mouse in order to increase the length of the stick sufficiently and then release the mouse in order to make the stick fall and connect the bridges.
In order to dodge the dragons that are being randomly generated the user is requested the press the mouse/ touch pad to make the warrior invisible.
A score counter (at the top right corner) updates itself after every successful stick creation to cross the gap between the platforms without the warrior falling.
A dragon counter (at the top left corner) updates itself every time the warrior successfully dodges a dragon.
